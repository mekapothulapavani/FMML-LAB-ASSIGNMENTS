If the validation set is small or unrepresentative of the overall data distribution, its accuracy may not be a reliable predictor of the test set accuracy. In such cases, increasing the size of the validation set can lead to more reliable predictions.\n",

        "Overfitting Detection: A larger validation set can provide a more robust signal for detecting overfitting. If the model is overfitting the training data, it's more likely to be identified when the validation set is sufficiently large. On the other hand, a small validation set may not capture the overfitting patterns effectively, leading to overly optimistic estimates of the model's performance.\n",
